#!/usr/bin/env zsh

# There are five startup files that zsh will read commands from:
#
# $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
# $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
# $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
# $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
# $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
#
# If ZDOTDIR is not set, then the value of HOME is used; this is the usual case.
#
# '.zshenv' is sourced on all invocations of the shell, unless the -f option is
# set. It should contain commands to set the command search path, plus other
# important environment variables. '.zshenv' should not contain commands that
# produce output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
#
# '.zshrc' is sourced in interactive shells. It should contain commands to set
# up aliases, functions, options, key bindings, etc.
#
# '.zlogin' is sourced in login shells. It should contain commands that should
# be executed only in login shells. '.zlogout' is sourced when login shells
# exit. '.zprofile' is similar to '.zlogin', except that it is sourced before
# '.zshrc'. '.zprofile' is meant as an alternative to '.zlogin' for ksh fans;
# the two are not intended to be used together, although this could certainly
# be done if desired. '.zlogin' is not the place for alias definitions,
# options, environment variable settings, etc.; as a general rule, it should
# not change the shell environment at all. Rather, it should be used to set the
# terminal type and run a series of external commands (fortune, msgs, etc).

### OH MY ZSH

# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will

# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="bureau"

# Set list of themes to pick from when loading at random
# Setting this variable when ZSH_THEME=random will cause zsh to load
# a theme from this variable instead of looking in $ZSH/themes/
# If set to an empty array, this variable will have no effect.
# ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=( "robbyrussell" "agnoster" )

# Uncomment the following line to use case-sensitive completion.
# CASE_SENSITIVE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to use hyphen-insensitive completion.
# Case-sensitive completion must be off. _ and - will be interchangeable.

# Uncomment one of the following lines to change the auto-update behavior
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode disabled  # disable automatic updates
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode auto      # update automatically without asking
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode reminder  # just remind me to update when it's time

# Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update (in days).
# zstyle ':omz:update' frequency 13

# Uncomment the following line if pasting URLs and other text is messed up.
# DISABLE_MAGIC_FUNCTIONS="true"

# Uncomment the following line to disable colors in ls.
# DISABLE_LS_COLORS="true"

# ENABLE_CORRECTION="true"

# Uncomment the following line to display red dots whilst waiting for completion.
# You can also set it to another string to have that shown instead of the default red dots.
# e.g. COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="%F{yellow}waiting...%f"
# Caution: this setting can cause issues with multiline prompts in zsh < 5.7.1 (see #5765)
# COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"

# Uncomment the following line if you want to disable marking untracked files
# under VCS as dirty. This makes repository status check for large repositories
# much, much faster.
# DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY="true"

# Uncomment the following line if you want to change the command execution time
# stamp shown in the history command output.
# You can set one of the optional three formats:
# "mm/dd/yyyy"|"dd.mm.yyyy"|"yyyy-mm-dd"
# or set a custom format using the strftime function format specifications,
# see 'man strftime' for details.
# HIST_STAMPS="mm/dd/yyyy"

# Would you like to use another custom folder than $ZSH/custom?

# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
